This site is in support of the the Tejano Trails App project submission to the Austin Hack for Change Event June 2-4 2017 - [atxhackforchange.org] . The App in progress itself can be found here [arcg.is/2mqx9Ez]. The app is an ArcGIS online application built around a web map of the sites listed in the Tejano Trails PDF here: [Tejano_Trail_revised2013.pdf]. This site will list the items that will need to be worked on by team from the Austin Hack for Change event. 

The creator of this site and the app was in no way involved in the creation of the Tejano Walking Trail. He is just a fan, often walks the Trail and thought this would be a good way to increase awareness and use of the Trail. Much thanks to all the hard work that went into creating the Trail. Please visit its official Facebook page here:
